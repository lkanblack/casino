                        <p>The purpose of the Internet Service is to provide its users with entertainment, enable them to get involved in contacts and discussions with other users sharing the same interests, and upgrade their knowledge on the issues of gaming.

It can happen however that using services provided in the Service, instead of its being the source of entertainment, will become for some users the way of spending excessive amounts of time. Such cases are rare and above all possible to avoid if only the following basic rules are observed:</p>
                        <ul class="mb-13">
                            <li>I play for fun.</li>
                            <li>I play for ranking points of no real value, I’m aware the only value of them is my satisfaction.</li>
                            <li>I try to win, but I never try to take revenge.</li>
                            <li>I can spend my free time also doing things other than playing games.</li>
